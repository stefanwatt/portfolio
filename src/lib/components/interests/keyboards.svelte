    <li>36 keys (Regular Full-Size-Board has about triple the keys)</li>
    <li>split design so your arms can be at shoulder width</li>
    <li>column staggered because your fingers have different lengths</li>
    <li>2 rotary encoders</li>
    <li>fully wireless thanks to nice!nano micro controller</li>
    <li>Workman Layout because QWERTY just makes no sense at all</li>

    I built this from scratch. It's the third one I've built. I started out with a 54-key
    split keyboard and then moved on to this. At first it was challenging to live with
    this only about half the keys. Then I realized I don't even use the top-most row and
    the outer-most column. So I can actually live with 36 keys. That means I never have to
    move my fingers more than one column/row from the home row. All the missing characters
    are accessed through layers (hold backspace + X/M/V = Number 1/2/3).
