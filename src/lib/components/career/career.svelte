        This is was my first job as a developer and also the company where I completed my
        apprenticeship. It's a very small company providing software services in the
        healthcare sector and I was the only web-developer.
      </p>
      <p>
        I worked as a full-stack developer using a typescript only stack with Svelte(Kit)
        as a frontend framework.
      </p>
      <p>
        I completed several small projects while working here but the most noteworthy one was
        an appointment-booking platform used mainly for Covid-19 vaccines and rapid tests.
        During the height of the pandemic over 40.000 users have booked their vaccinations
        with several large medical facilities using the service for their patients. I am
        very proud of my contribution to combat a global crisis.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is the biggest project that I've completed as a sole developer to this day.

        My current place of employment. It's one of the leading enterprises or hospital
        information systems. I've continued working as a full-stack developer in a team of
        ~10 people focusing on medication/administration of drugs.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was forced to leave my comfort zone of Svelte+NodeJS as we use Java+Angular
        here. It was a big jump in company size and consequently I'm sharing a code base
        with many devs. I can confidently say that I lived up to the challenges and
        adapted to the new situation very quickly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Making the move to this company was a very important decision in my life and also
        my professional development.
