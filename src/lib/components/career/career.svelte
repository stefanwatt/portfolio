      <p>
        This is was my first job as a developer and also the company where I completed my
        apprenticeship. It's a very small company providing software services in the
        healthcare sector and I was the only web-developer.
      </p>

      {#if readMoreMednet}
        <p>
          I worked as a full-stack developer using a typescript only stack with
          Svelte(Kit) as a frontend framework.
        </p>
        <p>
          I completed several small projects while working here but the most noteworthy
          one was an appointment-booking platform used mainly for Covid-19 vaccines and
          rapid tests. During the height of the pandemic over 40.000 users have booked
          their vaccinations with several large medical facilities using the service for
          their patients. I am very proud of my contribution to combat a global crisis.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the biggest project that I've completed as a sole developer to this day.

        My current place of employment. It's one of the leading enterprises or hospital
        information systems. I've been working as a full-stack developer in a team of ~10
        people focusing on medication/administration of drugs.
